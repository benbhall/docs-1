## Prerequisites

You'll need a Makeswift site. If you don't already have one, you can follow the [developer quickstart](/developer/quickstart) or [installation guide](/developer/app-router/installation) to get started.

- Github repository
- Vercel account ([sign up](https://vercel.com/signup))

## Create new project in Vercel

This guide uses the Vercel dashboard to deploy your Makeswift application.
Alternatively, you can use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

Within the Vercel dashboard, choose **Add New... > Project** from the top right.

## Connect to Github repo

Next, you'll need to connect your Github repository to Vercel. If you haven't already done so, you may need to authorize Vercel to have access the correct access.

After you've done so, you can choose your repository from the **Import Git Repository** section.

## Build and output settings

You can use default values for build and output settings. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and will choose the correct build settings for you.

- Root directory
- Build command
- Output directory
- Development command

## Environment variables

When deploying your Makeswift application, you'll need to include your `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY` as an environment variable. This key ensures your deployed site is correctly connected to Makeswift.

You can find your Makeswift site API Key in the Makeswift builder under **Settings > Host**.

  <img src="/images/site-api-key.gif" alt="How to get the site API key" />
</Frame>

Enter the API key in the Vercel dashboard.

## Deploy

After you finished configuring your settings, click the **Deploy** button. Vercel will build and deploy your Makeswift application. After the build has finished, you should see a success message with a link to your deployed site.
