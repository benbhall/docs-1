## Connect to Github repo

Next, you'll need to connect your Github repository to Vercel. If you haven't done so, you may need to authorize Vercel to have access to your Github repository. After you've done so, you can choose your repository from the **Import Git Repository** section.

## Environment variables

When deploying your Makeswift application, you'll need to include your `MAKESWIFT_SITE_API_KEY` as an environment variable. This key ensures your deployed site is correctly connected to Makeswift.

You can find your Makeswift site API Key in the Makeswift builder under **Settings > Host**.
