## Getting started

<Steps>

<Step title="Add locales in the Makeswift builder">
Open site settings and go to the "Locales" tab.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/localization-first-step.png"
    alt="Locales settings in Makeswift"
  />
</Frame>

To add a new locale, click the "+ Add locale" button. You can find options to modify or delete existing locales by hovering over the locale. You can also modify the default locale by hovering over it and clicking the edit button.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/localization-hover-locale.png"
    alt="Hovering over a locale row with more options displayed"
  />
</Frame>

Here's an example of a list of locales added to a Makeswift site:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/localization-manage-locales.png"
    alt="List of locales in Makeswift settings"
  />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure locales in your Next.js config">

The locales in your site settings need to match the locales configured in `next.config.mjs`. For example, to match the locales on the screenshot above, `next.config.mjs` should look like this:

<NextConfigLocalizedExample />

Note that in `next.config.mjs`, you also need to put your `defaultLocale` in `locales`.
For example, we're using `en-US` as the `defaultLocale`.

It is important to match the locales and the default locale in your Makeswift site settings to the locales configured in `next.config.mjs`. Otherwise
pages in the builder will not load properly.

</Step>

<Step title="Update snapshot fetching">
Once you set up locales in site settings and in the Next.js config, you need to pass the locale from `getStaticProps` to `getPageSnapshot`.

<PagesCatchAllLocalizedExample />

This code is usually located in `[[...path]].tsx`, but it might be different depending on your setup.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit your pages in the builder">

Once you've set everything up, you should be able to switch to the new locales using the locale switcher in the builder.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/localization-locales-switcher.png"
    alt="List of locales in locale switcher inside of the Makeswift builder"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  You can customize the path for each page in each locale. For example, if you
  have a company page at `example.com/company`, you can create the Spanish
  version of the page at `example.com/es/compania` or `example.es/compania`.
</Note>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Domain-based localization

If you don't provide a domain for a locale, the localized pages will be on the same domain as the default locale,
but nested in the locale's path. For example, `es` page URLs will look like `example.com/es/page`.

To use domain-based localization, just add the domain to the locale in your site settings:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/localization-domain-based-settings.png"
    alt="Adding domain-based locales in site settings"
  />
</Frame>

Then, add the domain to your `next.config.mjs`:

<NextConfigDomainLocalizedExample />

Once you've done that, the Spanish localized pages will be located on `example.es`.

## Localized resources

When making changes on a different locale you can override any property, including the page's pathname, metadata, and SEO tags.

You can also localize a global component. To do this, edit a global component within a localized page and then save the global component.

<Note>
  You must save a global component in a locale before switching and editing it
  in another locale.
