We recommend using the automatic setup to use Makeswift in a new Next.js app. If you have an existing Next.js app, you can use the [manual installation](/guides/manual-installation) guide.

## Requirements

You will need the following:

- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/en) or a later version
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
- Familiarity with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)

<Info>
  You don't need an existing Makeswift account to get started with this guide.

## Automatic setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the app">

    Inside the directory where you want to create your Next.js app, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx makeswift@latest init
    ```

    After confirming and naming your project, the CLI will create a new directory for your Next.js app with the Makeswift runtime installed.

    The CLI will also open Makeswift in a new tab in your browser where you'll continue integrating your app.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Next.js app to a Makeswift site">
    After logging in or signing up for a Makeswift account, you'll be prompted to select an existing site or create a new one to connect to your local Next.js app.

    <Accordion title="Select an existing site or create a new one">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/select-site.png" alt="Screenshot of select site to integrate" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Pick a template (optional)">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/select-template.png" alt="Screenshot of template picker" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Next.js app integrates with your Makeswift site">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/integrating.png" alt="Screenshot of linking Makeswift to your localhost" />
      </Frame>

      During this step, the Makeswift site API Key is stored as an environment variable inside your local `.env.local` file.
    </Accordion>

    <Warning>
      Make sure to check your console during the linking process. If the CLI fails to install dependencies you may need to install them manually.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    The browser will redirect you to the Makeswift builder once the integration is complete. If you skipped the template option, make sure to create a page first.

    <Accordion title="How do I create a page?">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/add-page.png" alt="Screenshot of add page" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    If you've integrated your Next.js app with an existing Makeswift site, you'll find some new custom components in the toolbar.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/registered-components.png" alt="Screenshot of custom components in toolbar" />
    </Frame>

    These components are located in the `components` directory of your Next.js app. You can explore the files ending with `.makeswift.ts` to learn more about [registering components](/reference/runtime/register-component).
