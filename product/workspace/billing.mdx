## Billing Basics

Billing information is located in your settings. In the billing view, you can:

1. View your current subscription plan, upcoming payment, and current usage.
2. Upgrade or downgrade your subscription.
3. Manage the payment method used for your subscription.
4. Manage tax IDs to be displayed on your invoices.
5. View and download invoices.

### **Subscription Plans**
