## Introduction

A path name is a string that identifies the location of a file or directory on the web server. It is part of the URL that specifies where an asset or page can be found within the website's file structure.

## Path Naming

In Makeswift, path names also serve as unique identifiers for each page. You cannot use the same path name for two separate pages. Makeswift will throw an error if you attempt to name two pages with the same path.

By default, when you create a new page, the Path name will be /page-x with x being the number of new page (e.g., makeswift.com/page-4).

When you duplicate a page it will copy the path name and add a suffix of -copy (e.g., makeswift.com/contact-copy)

For your homepage, you will likely not have a path name. This is signified by a single trailing slash “/” in the Path Name field.

Path names also dictate the Href of links, so pay attention to this when considering your internal linking structure.

## Path Name Localization

For users utilizing the [Localization](product/site/localization.mdx) feature, you may translate or alter path names within each locale as if they are separate pages. By default, each locale will inherit the path name of the base locale.

## Pro Tips

Path name changes are a common reason to use an Open Page reference instead of an Open Link Reference for buttons and links in Makeswift. Makeswift will maintain the correct path name under Open Page references, even if you change the path name multiple times.
