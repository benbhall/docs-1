If you already have a site and want to create a new one, click the **Create new site** button under the site list dropdown. If this is your first time using Makeswift, [create a free account](https://app.makeswift.com/signup). You'll then be taken to the page for creating a new site.

You have two options to get started: **Start with the builder** or **Integrate with Next.js**.

<Frame>![create a site](/images/quickstart/create-site.jpg)</Frame>

Click **Go to the builder**, and you'll have a list of templates to choose from. Templates come with existing assets (images, logos, etc.), colors, text styles, and layouts for you to begin customizing.

Choose the **Venture** template and click **use this site**.

<Frame>
  <video
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsInline
    title="Create new site from template"
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="/images/quickstart/create-site-from-template.mp4"
  ></video>
</Frame>

Once your new site is created, you'll be taken to the Visual Builder. Let's take a look at the different parts of the builder which is composed of 4 sections:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Navigation Panel">
    Explore your sites, pages, files, and settings.
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Component Toolbar">
  Access components to add to the Canvas.

<Tab title="Canvas">
  Build and customize your pages with components.
  <Frame>

  </Frame>
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Properties Panels">
    Edit properties of a page, site, or component.
    <Frame>
      ![ Makeswift builder panels](/images/quickstart/builder-layout-panels.jpg)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Before moving on, take a few minutes to explore the Canvas and its components. Click on any component in the Canvas to see its corresponding properties in the Properties Panels.
