## Introduction

Themeing is the concept of creating a style pallete for website. With [Site Colors](/product/site/site-colors) and [Text Styles](/product/site/text-styles) you can standardize the available stlyes for your content for all users in your workspace.

Applying themeing principles is the key to unlocking the power of Makeswift and enabling every member of your team to create content without any fear of creating any clashing visuals.

## Colors

While you can add as many colors as you want in your color pallete in Makeswift, we recommend you keep your pallete as small as possible. If your team only has a handful of colors to pick from when creating an element, it will make individual work look much more cohesive. In addition, if you were looking to do a minor rebrand using different colors, it's much easier to locate and replace colors on a smaller pallete.

<Tip>
  Try limiting your color pallete to no more than 10 colors to keep it more
  manageable.
</Tip>

## Text Styles

Text styles are another key to a more coehsive site. From an accessibility and SEO standpoint, you should have no more than 6-8 different text styles. Essentially you want one to accommodate your <Tooltip tip="Semantic structure is the use of HTML tags to convey the meaning and hierarchy of content on a webpage.">Semantic Structure</Tooltip>. This will assure that there aren't any errnous text blocks that could get overlooked by a website crawler.

<Tip>
  {" "}
  Text Styles and their HTML Semantic Heirarchy are managed in the Block Property,
  separate from the Text Style itself.
</Tip>

From a design perspective, having less Text Styles makes your site look less busy. You'll be able to convey the proper messaging by utilizing the correct Text Style.

## Global Components

While the main use case for [Global Componets](/product/components#global-components) is for components that you will want to make changes to globally, utilizing the "Detatch Instance" action is a great way to pre-build sections.

### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build your Global Component">
    Build out a section that you would like to repeat and create it as a global
    component.
    <Tip>See [layout](/product/layouts) for some inspriation.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag it where you want it">
    Once your component is in your component tray in the toolbar, its available
    for you to drag onto any page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detatch the global component">
    This is the most important step. Detatching this instance allows you to make
    edits without affecting the base global component across your site. You're
    essentially picking up from where you left off after step 1.
  </Step>
