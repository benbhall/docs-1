## Breadcrumbs <Icon icon="chevrons-right" iconType="duotone" />

If you have a lot of nested content on your page, it can be difficult to determine exactly how your boxes are structured. Breadcrumbs are designed to help you understand your page structure and make it easier to select and sort your boxes. To get to the breadcrumbs, hover over an element within the desired box. Move your cursor to the label found at the top left of the component and the breadcrumbs will open.

### Selection

You can hover over each breadcrumb to see its corresponding box or element. Click once on any breadcrumb in the list to select it.

### Sorting

You can also click and hold a breadcrumb to start sorting that highlighted box.

## Overlays <Icon icon="border-center-h" iconType="solid" />

Overlays are a group of controls you’ll see on most elements but most popularly, the [Box](product/toolbar/box.mdx)

In general, Overlays are used to control and define spacing around your elements.

### Grid

Box width is divided into a 12 column grid, allowing you to shift the proportions of the contents in the box by 1/12th at a time per row. To adjust, simply click and hold the dotted column line and drag.

### [Width](product/component/property-controls/width.mdx)

Similarly to [Image](product/toolbar/image.mdx) you can set a maximum width to a box or element to maintain consistent spacing between sections. You can either set a pixel value, or a percentage of the screen. Keep in mind [Device Toggle](product/canvas/device-toggle.mdx) when managing width across devices.

### [Margin](product/component/property-controls/margin.mdx)

Margin is the space between elements. With an element selected, drag the top or bottom handles to change its margin. For a box, they will be the top-most and bottom-most handle

Left or right margins become available in the sidebar when the element is left or right-aligned. You cannot adjust the left or right margins if the element is center aligned. In this case, try adjusting the width instead.

### [Padding](product/component/property-controls/padding.mdx)

Padding is the space created between a box's border and its contents. This differs from margin which is used to push elements away from each other.

Boxes contain extra handles on the inside when selected. Grab any of these inner handles to change its padding, which is displayed in green.

Padding can also be applied using the “Padding” panel.

You can always get rid of padding all together if it’s not necessary. The quickest way to do this when you’re on Desktop responsiveness is to rest Padding to Base.

<Note>
Hold the **⌥ Option (or Alt) key to change corresponding Margin/Padding, and ⇧ Shift  + ⌥ Option (or Alt) to change all Margin/Padding equally.**
