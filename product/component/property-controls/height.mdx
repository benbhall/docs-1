## Introduction

Height is used for grids of elements where you want the height of all of your cards to be the same, You’ll notice that while there are controls for [Width](/product/component/property-controls/width) of elements in Makeswift, there’s no granular controls of height as it’s driven by the amount of content.

By default, the height of a Box is set to be driven by its content (Auto). Alternatively, you can apply a height of “Stretch” which will automatically stretch the height of a Box to match the tallest element or Box found in the same row.

## Examples

### Stretch vs. Auto

## Pro Tips

Typically, you’ll use Stretch height for grids of cards so that your grid symmetrical and cleaner. Use this with Vertical [Alignment](/product/component/property-controls/alignment) if your content in each cards differs to enhance the symmetry even further.

Auto is typically just used on singular boxes where you want to container to fit the content.

## Developer Notes

Take the height control into account when creating components with predetermined heights. Depending on the component, you may be able to utilize the Makeswift builder height settings instead of hard coding it into the component.
