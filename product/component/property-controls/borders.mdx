## Introduction

Borders are visual boundaries that define the edges of elements on a webpage.

In Makeswift, borders are essential for defining and emphasizing the structure of your webpage's content. They can be applied to almost any element to enhance visual interest, highlight parts of the content, or separate sections. You can adjust their **thickness**, **color**, and **style** to achieve precise visual effects and create distinctive layouts.

### Edges

Customize border properties for each edge of an element. This feature provides control over the appearance of borders, letting you set distinct [thickness](product/component/property-controls/borders#thickness) for the top, bottom, left, and right edges. Separate edge controls enable striking layouts and highlight specific content areas.

### Thickness

Border thickness refers to the width of the border around an element. Adjusting thickness controls the visual prominence of borders, influencing the overall design. Specifying border thickness helps create elements with varying visual emphasis, from subtle accents to bold outlines.

### Color

Customizing border color adds visual interest, creates contrast, and reinforces branding. Use border color to enhance the aesthetic appeal of your webpages, establish visual hierarchy, and guide users' attention to key elements. Control over border color in Makeswift allows for versatile and impactful design choices.

### Style

Choose from styles like dotted, dashed, or solid lines to suit different design preferences. Dotted lines create a pattern of small dots; dashed lines consist of short dashes separated by spaces; and solid lines provide a continuous, unbroken border.

## Examples

### Card Borders

Apply borders to boxes to make them pop out as cards.

## Pro Tips

Borders complement shadows, giving your boxes a crisper edge and emphasizing the depth of the shadow.

Avoid using solid black for borders; make it more transparent to reduce visual harshness.
