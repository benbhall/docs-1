## Introduction

Content alignment refers to the positioning of text, images, and other elements within a Box or Section on a webpage. In Makeswift content alignment typically describes or vertical alignment (top, middle, bottom, and space between) to achieve desired visual balance and readability. Horizontal Alignment also exists in Makeswift within the [Margin](https://www.notion.so/Margin-d5fd4a7193c14c4ea795c30309dc8101?pvs=21) control (left, center, right). By controlling alignment properties, designers ensure that elements are properly organized and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Top

By default items will align to the top of your section or box. Typically you will use this if all of your contents have a similar [Height](/product/component/property-controls/height), or if you want specific content like your images to be in line across all of your elements in a row.

### Middle

Middle is a great way to center your elements with respect to one another, even if they differ in [Height](/product/component/property-controls/height).

### Bottom

Bottom is similar to Top and is used in situations where you may want specific content like a button to be in line across all of your elements in a row.

### Space Between

Space Between will set the Box’s content above and below at equal distances. If you want images to be in line at the top but a button to be in line at the bottom, this is a good alignment to use.

<Note>
Space Between only has an effect if the Box [Height](/product/component/property-controls/height) is set to stretch.

</Note>

When you place other elements in a box you can determine how the elements will be aligned with respect to one another using the “Align items” panel. By default, all content will align at the top of the Box. Content can also be aligned in the middle or anchored to the bottom. A fourth option of “Space Between” lets you space the Box's content apart at equal distances.

## Examples

### Hero Section - Center Align

For a Hero section it is typical to use center alignment.

### Pricing Cards - Space Between

In order to properly space cards where the amount of content varies, like a pricing card for instance, you'll want to utilize space between.
