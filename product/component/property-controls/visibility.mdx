## Introduction

The visibility control allows you to hide elements placed directly within that box. The visibility panel is a visual representation of the box’s layout.

To hide an element, click on its correlating rectangle within the panel. A hidden element is shown as a collapsed rectangle with a gray border.

## Examples

The most common example of when you’d use the visibility property is when designing for Mobile. Elements designed in the same row on Desktop will often stack on top of each other on Mobile to avoid resizing issues. This can be problematic for layouts that are optimized for Desktop.

<Note>
You can change an element’s visibility for each [Device Toggle](https://www.notion.so/Device-Toggle-84fcd5d87d26442783e6fe4c5f4c2cb3?pvs=21). Be sure to checkout (new doc) to see how you can use this strategically to influence design across devices.

## Pro Tips

You can utilize visibility to deliver completely different content experiences between devices. Simply add all of the content you would want to show and utilize the visibility property per device to customize each experience.

## Developer Notes

<Note>
Hiding elements using the visibility control still loads it on a page, keep this in mind when taking into account your page performance.
