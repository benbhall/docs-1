## Introduction

Padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. It's a crucial property that allows designers to control the spacing around elements, ensuring proper alignment, readability, and visual balance within a layout.

By adjusting the padding, you can create breathing room between content and borders, preventing elements from feeling cramped or cluttered. This differs from [Margin](/product/component/property-controls/margin) which is used to push elements away from each other.

Boxes contain extra handles in the [overlay](/product/overlays) on the inside when selected. Grab any of these inner handles to change its padding, which is displayed in green.

Padding can also be applied using the **Padding** panel in the sidebar.

You can always get rid of padding all together if it's not necessary. The quickest way to do this when you're on Desktop responsiveness is to reset Padding to Base.

## Examples

### Section Padding

Adding padding to your sections is crucial in guiding site visitors down your page. It helps determine when sections come into view which can also trigger [Animations](/product/component/property-controls/animations)

## Pro Tips

Padding is great to use for unique elements that require special spacing, but it's usually best to utilize [Margin](/product/component/property-controls/margin) or even better [Gap](/product/component/property-controls/gap) to achieve proper spacing.

### Resetting to Base

When the control label is purple, that means it's been overidden from default. To reset it to default (0 padding all around) simply click on the label and click “Reset to Base”. This is handy for components like [Box](/product/components#introduction) come with padding by default.

In addition, padding can be altered from device to device but the base will be inherited from the device immediately larger. Meaning when you use the Resetting to Base feature, it will not necessarily reset it to zero, but simply whatever it was on the previous device (Tablet for Mobile and Desktop for Tablet by default).

## Developer Notes

Keep in mind the ability to alter padding within Makeswift when [styling](/developer/reference/controls/style) components.

It may make sense to utilize a [slot](/developer/reference/controls/slot) to allow users to alter the padding to their choosing within a component
