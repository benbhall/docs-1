## Introduction

Boxes can have shadows to give them a more real-world, dimensional feel. Add shadows by clicking the “+” in the “Shadows” panel located in the sidebar. Here you can control the following options for the shadow:

- Type: drop or inner shadow
- Color
- Direction
- Distance: how far the shadow is from its element
- Blur: the softness of the shadow
- Spread: when blur is set to “0”, a larger size will act like a solid border

## Examples

You can change the color and angle of your shadow to add a glowing effect to a specific element.

@Andrew Reifman I think I need some examples from you here as I've never really used Shadows in a meaningful way. I'd like to capture any uses that used to take a long time to do with CSS or HTML or whatever.

## Pro Tips

<Note>
An element can have multiple shadows which can be layered and sorted as well, allowing you to get creative with how your elements appear.

To avoid destructive design, try to avoid importing assets with shadows included in the original file, as this can be added in Makeswift.

Be more subtle with your shadows and increase the spread

## Developer Notes

Since Shadows can be added to almost anything, it may not make sense to add shadows to your component if it isn’t controllable within Makeswift. Unless you have multiple shadows within your component, it will likely be better handled in Makeswift.
