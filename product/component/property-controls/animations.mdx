## Introduction

Animations add dynamic movement to your pages, enhancing the user experience. You can apply animations to a container (e.g., a box or section) and its direct child elements. Makeswift offers a variety of effects and customization options, including delay and stagger controls.

### Effect

Makeswift provides a comprehensive list of animation effects suitable for different types of content. Effects trigger once per page load, so refresh your preview or builder to see changes. Animations can be applied to containers or their direct children, allowing for flexibility in how elements animate.

In addition to the effects themselves, you are able to apply animations to either a [Box](product/builder/box.mdx) or Section, or to the items directly within that Box or Section. When adding animation to item in, it will only animate the direct children of the element where you applying that animation to.

### Delay

Delay is the time interval between when an animation is triggered and when it actually starts playing. It's a valuable tool for controlling the pacing and timing of animations, allowing designers to create more engaging and polished user experiences. By adjusting the delay, you can synchronize animations with user interactions or other events, ensuring a seamless and intuitive browsing experience. The trigger for animations is based on a percentage view in the view port of the section that you have animated.

<Note>
When applying animations to mobile devices, this is important to take into account as often sections that may not be as long on desktop due to multiple columns may become very long when stacking on mobile. This can cause content to be too delayed in populating and makes for a poor user experience. Be sure to test out or alter your animations for your Mobile device to avoid any issues with loading

</Note>

### Stagger

In Makeswift, the stagger control feature allows you to finely tune the timing and sequence of animations applied to the contents within a section of your webpage automatically. With this control, you can create visually appealing designs by orchestrating when different elements come into view. Makeswift essentially does the math for you on delay necessary to cascade each item in your element, and then applies the stagger to the content from left to right in the grid. Stagger control is only available for the Animate Items In property.

## Examples

### Animating a Section

### Animating Items In with Stagger

This is an exaggerated example of Stagger so that the difference between the to Animation Controls is more obvious.

### Using both Animation Controls on a Section and its Contents

You’ll notice that the grey section animates separately from the animation on the content itself. Take this into account when combining both animation controls, in this example the delay on the section prohibits the first two elements in the content from firing the animation at the right time.

## Pro Tips

In the example above of combining both animation controls, you’ll notice the delay on the larger grey section prohibits the first two elements in the smaller content section from firing the animation at the right time. Keep this in mind when adding animations, sometimes less is more!

## Developer Notes

If you have animations above the fold it can hurt your page performance score based on Google’s standards surrounding Largest Contentful Painting (LCP). It’s best to keep animations under the fold.

As a developer you can add your own animations to just about any component. While you can do this, take into consideration the animation controls available within Makeswift to determine whether you want to hardcode your animation to the component.
