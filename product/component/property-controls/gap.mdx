## Introduction

Gap is an easier way to uniformly control spacing between an elements contents. This is a quick and easy way to set and manage consistent margins between all items found within these elements.

### Row Gap

Row Gap refers to the distance between elements stacked on top of each other

### Column Gap

Column Gap refers to the distance between elements placed next to each other

## Examples

The most common example of using Gap is for sections containing multiple elements or cards. Simply select the smallest corresponding box that contains all the elements you're looking to space out, and utilize your Row and Column Gap controls.

## Pro Tips

It's best practice to apply Gap instead of Margin and Padding when possible. This assures that if you are to add or remove elements to a box that you don't have to readjust any of the spacing. It's also a great way to guardrail components you plan on using across your site and maintain consistency.

## Shortcuts

You can either drag and slide to increase Gap or simply input a number of pixels. It's best to eyeball it the first time by dragging, but then utilizing the pixel values to maintain that consistency throughout every section of your site.

## Developer Notes

When developing components, take into account the standard gap that designers are used to. It'll look weird if your component has 30 gap while everything else is using 50. See [Style](https://docs.makeswift.com/reference/controls/style).
