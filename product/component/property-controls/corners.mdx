## Introduction

Corners or Corner Radius refers to the measure of the curvature applied to the corners of a box or element. This radius affects how rounded the corners are. The corner radius is the radius of the circle that you could imagine being drawn inside the corner of a shape to create that rounded effect.

When specifying a corner radius, you are dictating how much the corner deviates from a sharp, right-angle point to a smoother, curved edge. The larger the radius, the more rounded the corner becomes. Corner radius is a common parameter in graphic design that can be applied almost anywhere in Makeswift.

## Examples

Rounded Cards

## Pro Tips

In Makeswift, you’re able to select which corners you want to change the radius for within a box, allowing you to create some interesting effects and shapes. Be sure to keep in mind the contents of your box or element as corner radius does not take content into account.

The more rounded a corner the friendlier the design. Maybe show examples of two different cards with varying corner radiuses

### Shortcuts

<Note>
Hold the **⌥Option (or Alt) key to change corresponding Corners, and ⇧ Shift  + ⌥ Option (or Alt) to change all Corners equally.**
