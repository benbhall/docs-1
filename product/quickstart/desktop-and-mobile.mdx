So far, you've only viewed your site on desktop, but Makeswift allows you to preview your site on sizes that simulate desktop, tablet, and mobile. Before previewing on different devices, take another look at the Hero component.

Notice this section has two columns: one for the text and button on the left and one for an image on the right. This section uses nested Boxes to create this two-column layout. To better visualize this, hover over the heading text to display the [Breadcrumbs](/product/layouts#breadcrumbs).

The structure of this section looks like this:

- `hero` - root Box for this section that includes padding
- `hero-content` - nested Box that has two columns of content
- `hero-text` - left Box containing the text and button
- `hero-graphic` - right Box containing the image

{/* TODO: video */}

With that in mind, let's take a look at what this layout looks like on a smaller screen. Use the dropdown menu to the right of the URL Bar at the top of the builder abd select **Mobile**.

Alternatively, you can also use the following shortcuts: `1` for desktop, `2` for tablet, and `3` for mobile.

{/* TODO: video */}

If you compare the hero on desktop and mobile, you'll notice that the layout changes to better fit the screen size by stacking `hero-text` and `hero-graphic` vertically.

{/* TODO: screenshot */}

If you explore the rest of the page, you'll notice a few other places where they layout has changed:

- the navbar collapses to a hamburger menu
- the list of features is stacked vertically

This is called responsive design. To learn more about how to build responsive designs, check out the [Responsive design docs](/product/responsive-design).

Styles always cascade from larger devices to smaller ones. These means you can build your core layout on desktop and then make adjustments for tablet and mobile.

To see how to build responsive layouts, switch the view to desktop and select the `hero-content` component and hover on the line that divides the two columns (text on the left and the image on the right). You're cursor will show an arrow pointing down and to the right. Clicking there will allow you to stack the two columns vertically. This is a common pattern for mobile layouts, and is what has already been taken care of for you with this template.
