## **Introduction**

Elements are instances of [components](/product/components) that you manage on the <Tooltip tip="Your creative space in the builder, where you can see your changes come to life in real time.">Canvas</Tooltip>. An Element can be as simple as a singular box, or a complex component comprising of multiple boxes, images, and text.

## **Custom element name and ID**

Name an element by selecting it and changing the default name at the top of the styles sidebar. Custom names must be alphanumeric and cannot contain any spaces.

A custom name will be displayed in breadcrumbs, also making it easier to discern between nested boxes.

Elements with custom names can also be scrolled to with buttons, images, and text links. All elements with custom names will appear in the scroll to dropdown found in on click panels.

Custom names also serve as IDs added to the element’s HTML that can be targeted by custom CSS and JavaScript.

## **Element actions**

Element actions can be found at the top right of the sidebar.

Duplicating an element (⌘ + D) creates an exact copy, including nested elements, either below or next to the original.

Copy an element (⌘ + C) to save it to your clipboard. When pasting (⌘ + V), you will be able to select exactly where to place the copied element, similar to sorting.
