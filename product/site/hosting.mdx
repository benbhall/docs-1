# Hosting

Hosting refers to where your Website App instance is located. You can either use Makeswift’s Default Host or create your own Custom Host. You'll choose an option when logging into Makeswift for the first time or when creating a new site in a workspace.

<Note>
You can have multiple Sites within a Workspace hosted either way.

## Default Host

Makeswift offers free hosting on our own application instance, allowing you to start building without the need for technical setup. This lets you dive into the builder using Makeswift's stock components.

You can still connect a custom domain with default hosting, but you may encounter limitations with other features.
