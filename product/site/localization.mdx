Localization involves adapting a website's content, layout, and functionality to meet the cultural, linguistic, and regulatory requirements of a specific target audience or geographic region. It goes beyond translation to ensure the website is effective and engaging for the local audience.

<Note>
Localization is available for Custom Hosts using Enterprise plans. For details on upgrading from a Free Plan, contact support at [support@makeswift.com](mailto:support@makeswift.com).

### **Adding Locales**

Makeswift's Locale feature allows you to manage localized versions of your web pages within the builder itself. Youâ€™ll need to configure your locales in code, and then add them into the Localization settings within Makeswift to enable the locale toggle in the builder.

<Note>
For detailed instructions on setting up locales, see our [Developer Docs on Localization](https://docs.makeswift.com/pages-router/localization#localized-resources)
