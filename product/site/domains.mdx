## **Custom Domains**

Domains are managed in your settings. Each new site begins with a "makeswift.site" domain. Click "Connect your domain" or "+ Add domain" to add a custom domain.

Once added, follow the instructions to set up your DNS to finish connecting your domain. You can also click the information icon to reopen the DNS instructions.

## **Updating Your DNS**

For domains with subdomains (e.g., "www" or "blog"), add a CNAME record with the host set to the subdomain ("www", "blog", etc.) and the value to "makeswift.site".

For domains without subdomains (naked or root domains), add an A record with the host set to "@" and the value set to "76.76.21.21".

**For your main website, include both the www and non-www versions of your domain.**

## **Setting a Primary Domain**

After adding one or more domains, select which domain to set as the primary domain. All other domains, as well as the Makeswift domain, will redirect to the primary one.

It can take up to 48 hours for your DNS to finish connecting. Once connected, all published page URLs will use your primary domain.

To ensure your home page uses only the primary domain (e.g., [www.mysite.com](http://www.mysite.com/)), edit the URL of the page and leave the "Path" field blank.

## **SSL Certificates**

All Makeswift pages automatically generate SSL certificates at no extra cost. Once your DNS has fully connected to Makeswift, it may take a little more time for the SSL certificate to be generated.
