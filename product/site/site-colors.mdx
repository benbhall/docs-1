## Introduction

Colors can be added either from any color picker, or within the theme sidebar when no element is selected.

# **Adding colors**

Add a color by clicking the “+” inside the color picker, or in the theme sidebar. Colors are shared by all pages in a site.

Enter a hex value value, or use the color sliders to create a color and click "Save". This color can now be applied to elements and text on your pages.

# **Managing colors**

To manage colors, deselect all elements to display the "Site colors" panel in the right sidebar. Click on an existing color to edit it, or delete the color from your site.

<Note>
**Color updates will be applied globally to your site, including live pages. Other changes on your pages will not be published.**

## Pro Tips

Try to minimize the number of site colors you have. This will allow you to standardize the resources you use on your website, so that less design decisions have to be made by editors.

## Developer Notes

When creating components that include color, be sure to use Makeswift's [Color](developer/reference/controls/colors/color.mdx) control.
