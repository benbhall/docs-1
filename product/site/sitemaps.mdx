#### **Introduction**

A sitemap is a file that provides information about the relationship between pages on your site. Search engines like Google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently. Lucky for you, an XML sitemap file is automatically generated for every site built in Makeswift. You can view your sitemap from the Site Settings menu.

<Note>
To configure the sitemap for your custom Next.js host, [read our developer docs](https://www.makeswift.com/docs/guides/sitemap)

</Note>

Located in every Page tab in the right sidebar, you can customize several sitemap tags. For more info check out [SEO Metadata](product/page/SEO-metadata.mdx) in our Builder Docs.

#### **Submitting your sitemap to Google**

Although your sitemap is automatically generated, it's recommended that you submit it to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/not-verified?original_url=/search-console/sitemaps&original_resource_id) so it can start crawling your site sooner. Navigate to your settings, and click “View sitemap” in the Sitemap section of the site settings. Copy and paste the URL from the new tab and paste it into the Search Console when prompted, then click “Submit”.
